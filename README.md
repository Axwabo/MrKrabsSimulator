# Mr. Krabs Simulator

A game about Mr. Krabs (who likes money)

Interact with characters & customers, and collect randomly appearing coins & cash!

Get as much money as you can to become the richest crab in all of Bikini Bottom!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The game works best in landscape orientation; also use full screen mode on mobile.

> [!TIP]
> The money piles up in the Office.

# Development

My vision was to emphasize "money," hence the various sound effects.

For other stuff, I just followed the "random bullshit go!" ideology.
